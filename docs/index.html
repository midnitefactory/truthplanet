<h1>SONIC 06 THE TRUTH</h1>
<td><p>&nbsp; Emailing Netiquette:</p>

<p>1. Don't keep the entire contents of a previous email in your response
unless necessary.</p>

<p>2. Leave only the sections of a previous post to which you are responding</p>

<p>3. Don't assume people know what you're responding to and who said it.</p>

<img src="s061.gif" align="BOTTOM" width="243" height="115"><br>

<p>4. If you want to talk about a subject, then start the discussion yourself,
don't harrass others to begin talking about it.</p>

<p>5. Chain letters are not acceptable &amp; in some places illegal.</p>

<p>6. Keep it short &amp; to the point. Some mail systems won't relay long
messages completely.</p>

<p>7. <img src="shouting.gif" align="BOTTOM" width="38" height="54" naturalsizeflag="3">Using ALL CAPITOL LETTERS is called shouting &amp;
is considered rude, showing anger. Be Careful!</p>

<p>8. Be very careful also with wit &amp; satire. Being funny in person
is interpreted with gestures &amp; expressions &amp; inflection of voice.
Writing includes none of that and can be very offensive unnecessarily if
not clearly designated as a funny remark. Use the <a href="smileys.html">smiley's</a>
and other indications to let people know you are only joking around.</p>

<p>9. DON'T send junk mail. If you haven't anything to say, don't say anything.
And don't send soliticious material unrequested - ie - SPAMMING. It costs
come users money to be on line downloading their mail &amp; you are &quot;stealing&quot;
from them when you send junk mail they have not asked for.</p>

<p>10. When using a list, keep personal messages separate. The others on
the list are not interested, nor should they have to take the time to read
your personal messages.</p>

<p>11. Don't send attachments to a list, as this could be expensive for
some on the list and some may have mail problems if the attachment is large.
Ask the list who would like to receive the attachment &amp; only send it
to those members.</p>

<p>12. Be sensitive in your correction of people on a list. If you have
a &quot;flame&quot; or rebuke to send, do it personally and consider well
it's necessity before sending.</p>

<p>13. Remember email is not a secure entity. Once sent your email can be
intercepted and read at various places. Do not send anything via email you
do not want the whole world to know about! Especially never send credit
card information via email.</p>

<p>When making purchases on the web, the site will tell you if the page
is secure or not. If it is a secure page you have nothing to worry about.
If it is not - don't use it!</p>

<p>14. Remember when you send email it is possible for it to become a permenant
fixure on someone's hard drive, printed out, saved onto disc or into other
files or documents. I repeat: Do not send anything via email you do not
want the whole world to know about! Take time to make sure you won't be
embarrassed later.</p>

<p>15. Try to keep your messages short, concise and easy to read. Use space
to set ideas apart and keep it manageable.</p>

<p>16. When dealing with lists, credit your sources and use documentation.
This lends credibility to your thoughts and deductions, as well as doing
right by those who have thought before you.</td>
